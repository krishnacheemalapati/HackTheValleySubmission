# Pollution is a Mis-Tech

## About

Pollution is a MisTech takes in a driver's start and end location. Granted Google deems there is a drivable path between start and end, we use the Google Maps API to calculate the distance between the two locations. Using historical data of the amount of emissions a car produces per kilometer, and the amount of emissions a tree absorbs in a day, the website outputs the amount of trees needed to offset the exhaust emissions of the car ride along with a visualisation of the car killing trees as it moves.

## Development Overview

We began our post-brainstorming development workflow by working on a rough mock-up of how we wanted our end result to be on Microsoft Paint. Then we proceeded to create a standardized UI on Figma. After this, we divided the tasks into research, front-end development (for which we used HTML, Javascript and CSS) and API incorporation. We also had regular team check-ins to address shortcomings, challenges faced during development, group debugging sessions, etc. After each of us completed our individual assignments, we had a team reunification of code where we addressed merge conflicts, and merged branches on GitHub to create a functional web application using a Domain.com domain. To finish up, we had a team review of code and quality assurance.
